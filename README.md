# Image Filtering and Thresholding using OpenCV and PyQt5

## Supported operations

### Filtering  
Includes the following kernels for filtering:
1. Identity
2. Edge
3. Sharpen
4. Blur (average and gaussian)
6. Custom - enter any matrix and apply onto image

### Thresholding
Includes the following thresholding methods:
1. Global - manually set threshold
2. Adaptive (mean and gaussian)
3. Otsu (direct and with gaussian blur)

## How to use

### Method 1 - download release and run (Windows only)  
you'll find it on the right side of the git repo page

### Method 2 - run in python virtualenv  
1. set up the venv `python -m venv .venv`
2. activate the venv using one of the appropriate scripts inside the `.venv/Scripts/` directory
3. install the required dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. finally, run it using `python main.py`

#### To build using PyInstaller
`pyinstaller --name='<whatever you want>' --windowed --onefile --add-data "undo-arrow.png;." main.py`
